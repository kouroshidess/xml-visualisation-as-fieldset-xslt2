# XML visualisation as ASCII or HTML fieldset (XSLT 2.0)
A couple of zero or low configurable stylesheets to transform *any* data-centric XML document to provide an automated visualisation as ASCII or HTML fieldset presentation. For example it is ideal as a quick rendition for FpML documents. 

## As ASCII
* TBC.

## As HTML
* Terminal window and MS Windows CSS themes provided.
* CSS filename can be swapped out by passing stylesheet $theme parameter.
* Simple JavaScript functionality adds collapse and expand feature on clicking fieldset legends. 
* local:path() builds current node XPath as fieldset legend title tooltip. 

## Other notes
* local:camel-case-to-words() manages XML tree node names to presentable fieldset legends.
